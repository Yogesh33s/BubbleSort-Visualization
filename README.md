Algorithm Visualizer

A Python project to visualize the Bubble Sort algorithm using `matplotlib`.

Overview

This project creates a visual representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm, allowing users to see the sorting process in action. As the algorithm progresses, the program updates the display to show the current state of the array being sorted.

 Features

- Visualize the Bubble Sort algorithm step-by-step.
- Interactive plot updates using `matplotlib`.
- Visual distinction of the final sorted state.

 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` library
- `numpy` library
